# CalendarPlanner
Calendar Planner is an application where you can add your tasks by day and time using a calendar. 
In this app I tried my best to make it following Clean Architecture and used Dagger 2 for DI, Room to store tasks, Coroutines and Navigation. Also, I used strings.xml to localize it to several languages.
## Ongoing changes
Application will be modified in the future by adding notifications to remind users of their tasks.
